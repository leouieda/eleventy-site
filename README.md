# Source code for an Eleventy site

Learning how to use this thing: https://www.11ty.dev

## Notes

We're using a `Makefile` to create rules for building, serving, and cleaning
the website.

* Build the website: `make` or `make all`
* Serve the HTML to http://localhost:8080: `make serve`
* Clean the built HTML files (the `_site` folder): `make clean`
